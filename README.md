### Overview

This is a blazing fast âš¡, command line license generator for your open source projects written in Go.

I know that GitHub has a great GUI to add licenses to projects but I always found myself doing too much work. First you have to go to GitHub, create a file, type 'LICENSE', pick a license, push it and then pull it locally. With this you can just generate the license locally and push it to GitHub.

This is my first Go program, so I made this simple project (still very beginner).

### Installation

#### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/its-ag/license-generator
cd license-generator

```

If you don't have go installed, you can download the executable from the [releases](hhttps://github.com/its-ag/license-generator/releases/tag/Latest) section.

### Usage

```
